# Rust_CMIMC_Optimization_3

CMIMC Programming Contest 2021
Optimization Round Problem 3 (Robot Recovery)

Recreated with Rust and optimized.

Rather than using the A* algorithm to find the fastest path from each robot to the exit, this method brings the robots together from furthest to closest (to the exit).
